## Installation

Install the SDK using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install paymanai
```

```bash poetry
poetry add paymanai
```

```bash pipenv
pipenv install paymanai
```

</CodeGroup>

## Setup

Before making requests, initialize the SDK with your **API key** from the [Payman Dashboard](https://app.paymanai.com/dashboard/api-keys).

> For more details, check out [Get API Key](/api-reference/get-api-key) section.

```python
from paymanai import Paymanai

payman = Paymanai(
    x_payman_api_secret="your_api_key",
    environment="sandbox"  # Switch to 'production' when live
)
```

<Note>
	Keep `environment='sandbox'` while testing. Use `'production'` only for real
	transactions.
</Note>

## Testing the Setup

To test if the SDK is setup correctly, run the following code in your Python environment:

```python
payee = payman.payments.create_payee(
    type="US_ACH",
    name="John Doe",
    account_holder_name="John Doe",
    account_number="1234567890",
    routing_number="011000138",
    account_holder_type="individual",  # 'individual' or 'business'
    account_type="checking"
)

print(f"Payee {payee.name} created successfully!")
```

It should show the following output in your terminal:

```bash
Payee John Doe created successfully!
```

## Using Type Hints

The SDK includes comprehensive type hints for better code safety and IDE support:

```python
from paymanai.types import PaymentDestination, PaymentResponse
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any

def process_customer_payment(
    amount: float,
    destination_id: str,
    memo: Optional[str] = None,
    metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> PaymentResponse:
    """Process a payment with optional metadata."""
    return payman.payments.send_payment(
        amount_decimal=amount,
        payment_destination_id=destination_id,
        memo=memo,
        metadata=metadata
    )
```

## Handling Errors

Because things **don't always go as planned**, the SDK uses standard Python exception handling:

```python
from paymanai.errors import PaymanError

try:
    payment = payman.payments.send_payment(
        amount_decimal=100.0,
        payment_destination_id="dest_123"
    )
    print(f"Payment successful: {payment.reference}")
except PaymanError as error:
    print(f"Payment failed: {error.message}")

    if error.code == "insufficient_funds":
        print("Not enough funds in wallet")
    elif error.code == "invalid_destination":
        print("Payment destination is invalid")
```
