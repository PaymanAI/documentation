## Installation 

Install the SDK using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install paymanai
```

```bash yarn
yarn add paymanai
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install paymanai
```

</CodeGroup>

## Setup 

Before making requests, initialize the SDK with your **API key** from the [Payman Dashboard](https://app.paymanai.com/dashboard/api-keys).

> For more details, check out [Get API Key](/api-reference/get-api-key) section.

```typescript
import Paymanai from "paymanai";

const payman = new Paymanai({
	xPaymanAPISecret: "your_api_key",
	environment: "sandbox", // Switch to 'production' when live
});
```

<Note>
	Keep `environment: 'sandbox'` while testing. Use `'production'` only for
	real transactions.
</Note>

## Testing the Setup

To test if the SDK is setup correctly, run the following code in your node environment:

```typescript
async function testSetup() {
  try {
    const payee = await payman.payments.createPayee({
      type: "US_ACH",
      name: "John Doe",
      accountHolderName: "John Doe",
      accountNumber: "1234567890",
      routingNumber: "011000138",
      accountHolderType: "individual", // 'individual' or 'business'
      accountType: "checking"
    });
    
    console.log("✅ Payee John Doe created successfully!");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Setup test failed:", error.message);
  }
}

testSetup();

```

It should show the following output in your terminal:

```bash
✅ Payee John Doe created successfully!
```

<Note>
	The SDK is written in TypeScript and provides full type definitions for all
	methods and parameters.
</Note>
## Handling Errors 

Because things **don't always go as planned**, the SDK uses standard Promise-based error handling:

```typescript
try {
	const payment = await payman.payments.sendPayment({
		amountDecimal: 100.0,
		paymentDestinationId: "dest_123",
	});
} catch (error) {
	console.error("Payment failed:", error.message);
}
```
