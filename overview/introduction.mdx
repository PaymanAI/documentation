![Introducing Payman](/images/intro.png)
Payman is the first secure financial platform built specifically to let AI agents move money without direct access to customer funds.

When you sign up on [Payman](https://app.paymanai.com), you get:

-   A **test wallet (TSD)** with 1000 TSD for sandbox testing.
-   The option to subscribe to **USD** (for US users) or **USDC** (for international users) wallets for real transactions.

### What You Can Do

Whether you're a user or developer, you can:

-   **Create or subscribe to wallets**
-   **Set policies** to define spending limits and approval rules
-   **Add payees**, such as test payees, crypto wallets or US bank accounts
-   **Approve or deny requests** when spending exceeds the policy

### What Developers Can Do

Developers have access to everything users can do, plus:

-   **Register apps** that require automated payments
-   **Configure wallets and policies** specific to an app
-   **Use client credentials** to perform transactions (TSD in sandbox, USD/USDC in production)
-   **Enable OAuth** to let their own users sign up with Payman and give wallet access (requires approval)

### Built for Control and Automation

Payman supports both dashboard and programmatic usage:

-   Fully managed through a simple dashboard
-   Integrate with our **Node.js SDK**
-   Explore and test via the **Playground**

Payman is built to bring payments to AI agents, while keeping transparency, safety, and user approval at the core.
