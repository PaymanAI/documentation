## Why Payman?

Traditional payment systems assume a human is behind every transaction. But today, AI agents also need the ability to move money — safely, with rules, and under human control.

Payman bridges this gap. It’s a secure financial platform where both humans and AI agents can transact with complete transparency and programmable policy enforcement. Every payment is governed by user-defined rules — so nothing moves without oversight.

## Getting Started with Payman

To access Payman, **Users** and **Developers** must first request an invite code. Once you receive your invite code, you can register on the [Payman Dashboard](https://app.paymanai.com). After registration, you can set up your wallets, policies, and begin using the platform's features.

> **Note:** Invite codes are required to ensure secure onboarding and controlled access during our early access phase.

### Wallets

-   **USD Wallet**: Available for US-based users for real USD transactions.
-   **USDC Wallet**: Available for both US and International users for real USDC (stablecoin) transactions.
-   **Test Wallet (TSD)**: Every account is provisioned with a test wallet containing 1000 TSD for simulation purposes. This lets you safely build and test before going live.

> **Note:** There is no subscription required to create or use wallets. All wallets are managed directly from your Payman Dashboard after registration.

## User Features

**Users** on Payman can:

-   **Create Wallets**: Set up USD or USDC wallets for real transactions.
-   **Set Policies**: Define spending limits, approval rules, and other controls to govern how funds can be accessed or moved.
-   **Add Payees**: Add recipients such as test payees, crypto wallets, or US bank accounts.
-   **Approve or Deny Requests**: Receive notifications and approve or deny payment requests that exceed your defined policies, ensuring you always have the final say.

## Developer Features

**Developers** have access to all User features, plus:

-   **Register Applications**: Set up apps that require automated or programmatic payments.
-   **Configure App-Specific Wallets and Policies**: Tailor wallets and policies to the needs of each application.
-   **Use Client Credentials**: Authenticate securely for server-to-server automation using TSD, USD, or USDC.
-   **Enable OAuth for End Users**: Allow your users to sign up with Payman and grant wallet access to your app (requires approval).

## Role Overview

Here’s a quick breakdown of who does what in Payman:

| Role          | Purpose                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**      | Creates wallets, defines policies, approves or denies payments                          |
| **Developer** | Builds apps, configures programmatic access, uses SDKs or OAuth                         |
| **AI Agent**  | Executes actions via developer apps — but always under user-defined limits and policies |

## Built for Control and Automation

Payman is designed for both dashboard-based control and full programmatic automation:

-   **Dashboard**: Manage everything through a user-friendly web interface.
-   **TypeScript SDK**: Integrate Payman into your applications using our official TypeScript SDK for robust, type-safe automation.
-   **Playground**: Explore and test API calls and workflows interactively before deploying to production.

Common use cases include AI-driven payroll, expense approvals, reimbursements, and autonomous tipping — all without giving agents unrestricted access to funds.

Whether you're an AI developer or just need programmable money movement, Payman gives you full control and safety by design.
