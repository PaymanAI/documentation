## Prerequisites

-   Request an [invite code](https://app.paymanai.com) and register on Payman
-   Enable Developer Mode in your dashboard

## Step 1: Install the SDK

```bash
npm install @paymanai/payman-ts
```

## Step 2: Register Your App

1. Go to your [Payman Dashboard](https://app.paymanai.com)
2. Navigate to **Apps** â†’ **Register App**
3. Fill in your app details and save
4. Configure your app with:
    - At least one wallet (TSD for testing)
    - At least one payee
    - A policy (choose "Personal Use" to start)

## Step 3: Get Your Credentials

1. Go to the **Credentials** tab in your app
2. Generate **Test Credentials**
3. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

## Step 4: Set Up Environment

Create a `.env` file in your project:

```env
PAYMAN_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
PAYMAN_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

## Step 5: Write Your First Integration

```typescript
import { PaymanClient } from "@paymanai/payman-ts";

// Initialize the client
const payman = PaymanClient.withClientCredentials({
	clientId: process.env.PAYMAN_CLIENT_ID!,
	clientSecret: process.env.PAYMAN_CLIENT_SECRET!,
});

async function quickDemo() {
	try {
		// Check your wallets
		const wallets = await payman.ask("List all wallets and their balances");
		console.log("My wallets:", wallets);

		// Create a test payee
		const newPayee = await payman.ask(
			"Create a payee of type Test Rails called John Doe"
		);
		console.log("New Payee Detail:", newPayee);

		// View your payees
		const payees = await payman.ask("List all payees");
		console.log("My payees:", payees);

		// Send a test payment (using TSD test funds)
		const payment = await payman.ask("Send 10 TSD to John Doe");
		console.log("Payment sent:", payment);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error("Error:", error.message);
	}
}

quickDemo();
```

## Step 6: Run Your Code

```bash
node your-file.js
```

That's it! You've successfully integrated with Payman and sent your first payment.

>ðŸŽ‰ **Ready for production?** You've just completed testing with TSD (Test Dollar) funds. To process real payments, generate **Live Credentials** in your dashboard, add USD or USDC wallets, and update your environment variables - your existing code will work seamlessly with real money!
