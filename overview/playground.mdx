Payman [Playground](https://app.paymanai.com/dashboard/playground) provides you with a financial sandbox. It's where you can test a real AI payment agent without the worry of moving actual money. Send test payments, try different commands, and watch exactly how the API works behind the scenes.

## Your First AI Agent

When you sign up for Payman, we automatically create an AI agent for you to play with. This agent comes ready to use with fake money and test accounts.

## Chat with Your Agent

If you are confused, simply type the following message:

```
what can you do?
```

Your agent will show you its capabilities, including how to:

-   Find people you can pay
-   Send payments
-   Add new payment recipients
-   Check your balance
-   Generate payment links

## Try These Commands

Jump right in with these example commands:

-   Type `/who` to see who you can pay
-   Type `/send $50 to Jane` to create a test payment
-   Type `/add new payee` to add someone new

## See the Magic Behind the Curtain

The coolest part? As you chat with your agent, you'll see the actual API calls happening in real-time on the right panel. This shows you exactly what's happening behind the scenes - perfect for when you're ready to build your own integration.

## It's All Simulated

Feel free to experiment without worry. All transactions in the Playground run in the **sandbox** environment, so you can:

-   Test the full payment experience
-   Approve transactions
-   Try different payment scenarios
-   Make mistakes without consequences

<Note>
	Everything in the Playground is simulated. No real money moves, no matter
	what commands you try.
</Note>

## Ready to Build Your Own?

After playing around in the Playground, you'll have a clear picture of how to implement these payment features in your own projects:

1. Check out the API calls that appear when you use different commands
2. Reference our [SDK documentation](/sdks) for implementation details
3. Use your API keys to start building with confidence
