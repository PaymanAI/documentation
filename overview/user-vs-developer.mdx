![User vs Developer](/images/UservsDev.png)
Payman is for:

-   **Users**: who manage their own money using wallets, policies, and payees. Delegate scoped wallet access to AI Apps built on Payman
-   **Developers**: who build apps or AI agents that programmatically interact with the Payman platform.

Here’s a full breakdown of what each can do:
