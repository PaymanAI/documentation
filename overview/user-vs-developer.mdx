Payman is built for **two types of people**: those who use Payman wallets and policies to manage their own money, and those who build apps or agents that interact with them.

---

## 👤 Users

Users are individuals who:

-   Want to create and manage **USD or USDC wallets**
-   Set up **policies** to control how and when money moves
-   Add payees and **review or approve payment requests**
-   **Sign in to third-party apps using Payman OAuth**

If a developer has integrated Payman OAuth into their app, users can log in using their Payman account. During sign-in, users select:

-   Which **wallet** to link
-   Which **policy** should govern its use

This gives users full control and **guardrails** over how their wallet can be accessed or used by the third-party application — including spend limits, thresholds, and approval logic.

---

## 🛠️ Developers

Developers are users who also want to:

-   Build apps or AI agents that **move money programmatically**
-   Use the **Payman SDK** and **APIs** to create, pay, and manage
-   Implement **OAuth** to let users connect their wallets to your app

By registering an app, a developer can:

-   Integrate Payman into their own platform
-   Allow users to sign in and link their Payman account
-   Respect user-defined policies and thresholds automatically

If you're building anything that involves financial automation using Payman — you're a developer.

### TL;DR

| Concept               | Users            | Developers            |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Create Wallets        | ✅               | ✅                    |
| Set Policies          | ✅               | ✅                    |
| Send Payments via SDK | ❌               | ✅                    |
| Use OAuth Flow        | ✅ (as a signer) | ✅ (as an integrator) |

> 💡 **Every developer is a user**, but not every user is a developer.
