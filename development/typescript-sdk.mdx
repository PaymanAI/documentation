---

The easiest way to move money with your AI agent. Built for TypeScript developers who want power, safety, and speed.

---

## Quick Install

```bash
npm install @paymanai/payman-ts
```

<Info>Node.js 20+ is required for full compatibility.</Info>

---

## Environment Setup

Before you start, add your credentials to a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
PAYMAN_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
PAYMAN_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

<Note>Get these from your Payman dashboard after registering an app.</Note>

---

## Authentication & Initialization

You can initialize the client in several ways, depending on your use case:

### Client Credentials (Recommended)

```ts
import { PaymanClient } from "@paymanai/payman-ts";

const payman = PaymanClient.withCredentials({
	clientId: process.env.PAYMAN_CLIENT_ID!,
	clientSecret: process.env.PAYMAN_CLIENT_SECRET!,
	name: "my-client", // optional
	sessionId: "ses-abc", // optional
});
```

### OAuth Authorization Code

```ts
const payman = PaymanClient.withAuthCode(
	{
		clientId: "your-client-id",
		clientSecret: "your-client-secret",
	},
	"your-auth-code"
);
```

### Access Token or Refresh Token

```ts
const payman = PaymanClient.withToken(
	{
		clientId: "your-client-id",
	},
	{
		accessToken: "your-access-token",
		expiresIn: 3600,
		refreshToken: "your-refresh-token",
	}
);
```

---

## Making Requests

Ask questions, send money, or trigger actionsâ€”all in one line.

### Formatted Response (default)

```ts
const response = await payman.ask("How much money do I have in my wallet?");
console.log(response);
```

### Raw JSON Response

```ts
const raw = await payman.ask("How much money do I have in my wallet?", {
	outputFormat: "json",
});
console.log(raw);
```

### Streaming Responses

```ts
await payman.ask("List all payees", {
	onMessage: (msg) => console.log("Live:", msg),
	outputFormat: "markdown",
});
```

<Tip>
	Use <code>onMessage</code> for real-time updates, long-running tasks, or
	progress monitoring. Streaming is ideal for workflows where you want to
	process results as they arrive.
</Tip>

---

## Metadata

Attach metadata to requests for extra context and control over how your requests are processed:

```ts
await payman.ask("Pay Tyllen $50?", {
	metadata: { source: "mobile-app", userId: "user123" },
	messageMetadata: { priority: "high" },
	partMetadata: { currency: "USD" },
});
```

---

## Session Management

<Info>
	Sessions allow you to maintain context across multiple requests. Each client
	instance manages its own session by default, so you can have ongoing
	conversations or workflows that remember previous actions.
</Info>

### How Sessions Work

-   Every time you create a client, a new session is started unless you provide a `sessionId`.
-   The session ID is included in every response from `payman.ask()`.
-   You can use this session ID to resume a conversation or workflow at any time, even across different client instances or after a restart.

### Resuming a Session

To resume a previous session, pass the `sessionId` when initializing the client:

```ts
// Start a conversation
const first = await payman.ask("How much money do I have?");
const sessionId = first.sessionId; // Save this for later

// Resume the conversation with a new client instance
const payman2 = PaymanClient.withCredentials({
	clientId: "your-client-id",
	clientSecret: "your-client-secret",
	sessionId,
});
const response2 = await payman2.ask("What did we talk about earlier?");
```

You can also resume with the `withToken` method:

```ts
const payman3 = PaymanClient.withToken(
	{
		clientId: "your-client-id",
		sessionId: sessionId,
	},
	{
		accessToken: "your-access-token",
		expiresIn: 3600,
	}
);
```

To get the current session ID from any client instance:

```ts
const currentSessionId = payman.getSessionId();
```

<Check>
	Session management is essential for building conversational agents,
	multi-step workflows, or any scenario where you want to maintain state
	across requests.
</Check>

---

## Token Management

Tokens are fetched and refreshed automatically. You can also access them directly if needed:

```ts
const tokenInfo = await payman.getAccessToken();
const refreshToken = payman.getRefreshToken();
```

<Check>
	Tokens refresh automatically before they expire. If you provide a refresh
	token, the SDK will use it as needed.
</Check>

---

## Error Handling

All API calls throw if something goes wrong. Catch and inspect errors as needed:

```ts
try {
	const res = await payman.ask("What's my balance?");
} catch (error: any) {
	if (error.response) {
		console.error(error.response.data);
	} else {
		console.error(error.message);
	}
}
```
