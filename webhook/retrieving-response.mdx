## Overview

Webhooks enable your AI Agent to receive real-time notifications about payments, approvals, and balance changes. Set up a webhook endpoint to automate responses to these events.

## Setup

### 1. Create Endpoint

Create an HTTPS endpoint on your server to receive webhook events:

```javascript
app.post('/webhook', express.json(), (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;
  
  // Handle the event
  handleWebhookEvent(event);
  
  // Return 200 to acknowledge receipt
  res.status(200).send();
});
```

### 2. Register Webhook URL

1. Go to your [Agent Settings](https://app.paymanai.com/dashboard/agents)
2. Add your webhook URL
3. Save changes

## Event Types

```typescript
enum EventType {
  // Customer Deposits
  CUSTOMER_DEPOSIT_PENDING = "customer-deposit.pending",
  CUSTOMER_DEPOSIT_SUCCESS = "customer-deposit.successful",
  CUSTOMER_DEPOSIT_FAILURE = "customer-deposit.failed",

  // Balance Alerts
  BALANCE_LOW = "balance.low",  // Triggered at 50% of peak balance

  // Payment Approvals
  PAYMENT_APPROVED = "approval-request.approved",
  PAYMENT_REJECTED = "approval-request.rejected",
  PAYMENT_FAILED = "approval-request.failed"
}
```

## Event Format

All webhook events follow this structure:

```json
{
  "eventType": "customer-deposit.successful",
  "details": {
    "customerId": "user_123",
    "amount": 10000,  // $100.00 (in cents)
    "currency": "USD",
    "metadata": {
      "sessionId": "abc123",
      "orderId": "order_789"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using Metadata

Track context across events by including metadata in your requests:

```javascript
// When creating a deposit link
const checkout = await payman.payments.initiateCustomerDeposit({
  customerId: 'user_123',
  amountDecimal: 100.00,
  metadata: {
    sessionId: 'abc123',
    orderId: 'order_789'
  }
});

// Later, in your webhook handler
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;
  if (event.eventType === 'customer-deposit.successful') {
    const { sessionId, orderId } = event.details.metadata;
    // Resume processing with original context
  }
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Acknowledge Quickly**
   - Return a 200 status immediately
   - Process events asynchronously
   - Avoid long-running operations in the handler

2. **Handle Retries**
   - Events may be sent multiple times
   - Implement idempotency checks
   - Store processed event IDs

3. **Verify Events**
   - Validate event format
   - Check required fields
   - Process events in order
