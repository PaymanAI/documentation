One of the key benefits of getting humans work with your AI Agents is to act upon their responses.

In order to do this we've made it easy to add a webhook for your AI Agent to retrieve responses.

In order to do this follow these steps.

1. Create a webhook to retrieve responses.
2. Once you've done so, head on over to your Agents profile page on the <a href="https://app.payman.dev">Payman Platform</a>.
3. Click on the webhooks tab and enter in your webhook url and add any parameters then click submit.

Now, anytime a task is completed, the response will be returned and your AI Agent will be able to action off of it.
