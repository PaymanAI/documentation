## Your AI Agents First Payment

Here we'll walk you through how to

- Get your AI Agent API Key
- Fund your AI Agent
- Have your AI Agent make a payment

### Sign Up To Payman Platform

Go to the <a href="https://app.paymanai.com">Payman web app</a> and sign up for an account. Sign up as a developer and get onboarded.

### Link an Account

In order to fund a Wallet with real funds you will need to verify your identity and link an account. However, if you enable _Developer Mode_
mode using the switch at the top of the screen this will place you in a sandbox area where we will automatically create a test wallet for you.

### Create a Wallet

Allow your AI Agent access to the platform by creating a Wallet and getting your Payman API Key.
This will give the Agent the ability to spend funds.

### Fund your Wallet & Get API Key

In order to create a new wallet you will need to add funds. Currently we support USD, with USDC coming soon.

</Frame>

Make sure you added a payment method for the currency you are trying to use as you will need it to fund your wallet.

Once you've funded the wallet, be sure to store the secret API Key you are shown:

```js API Secret
PAYMAN_API_SECRET = "*****************";
```

### Create Payee

In order for the AI Agent to have somewhere to send the funds, you will need to first set up a payee on the Payman system.

-- TODO add more details here

### Integrate API into AI Agent

Add Payman's API to your AI Agent Tool capabilities. We've provided what an example AI agent using Payman looks like. This example uses
Langchain, but any other agentic framework can be used as well.

<CodeGroup>

```python Langchain.py
import requests
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain import hub
from langchain.tools import tool
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_openai_functions_agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Load the .env file
load_dotenv()

@tool
def make_payment() -> str:
    """Make a payment to a payee using the Payman platform""" #Instructions for the AI Agent on when to use Payman API
    headers = {
        "x-payman-api-secret": os.getenv("PAYMAN_API_SECRET")
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Accept": "application/vnd.payman.v1+json"
    }
    payload = {
        "paymentDestinationId": <the ID of the payee you created above>,
        "amountDecimal": "50.00", # This will result in the AI paying 50 USD to the destination
    }

    try:
        # Replace the URL with "https://api.paymanai.com/api/tasks" if you want to create real tasks with real money on the live system
        response = requests.post("https://api-sandbox.paymanai.com/api/tasks", headers=headers, json=payload)
        return response.content
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
        raise SystemExit(e)

tools = [create_task]
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/openai-functions-agent:a1655024")
agent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)

agent_executor.invoke({"input": """
    "input": "Ask the user to confirm the payment and if they say it's okay, then make the payment using Payman."
"""}) # Example Prompt Description For AI Agent
```

</CodeGroup>

### Run The Code Above To Make a Payment

You can actually run the code above as python script to post your first task to Payman.

To run this agent, create a `.env` file in this directory and put the following environment variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your openAI API key - the agent will use the gpt-4o model by default>
PAYMAN_API_SECRET=<your Payman API Secret for that agent>
```

Create a `agent.py` file where your example agent code above will be pasted. Replace the Payman variables in there with the environment variables you created.

Now install the dependencies and run the agent.

```
pip install -U langchain-openai langchain-community langchainhub langchain openai python-dotenv
python agent.py
```

Once you have done this you can communicate with the agent and have it make the payment!

<Note>
  If you have not funded your AI Agent with the right amount of funds to spend
  based on the payment above, then you need to adjust accordingly!
