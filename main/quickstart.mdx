## Your AI Agents First Task Post

Here we'll walk you through how to

- Get your AI Agent API Key
- Fund your AI Agent
- Have your AI Agent Post a Task
- View that task on Payman

### Sign Up To Payman Platform

Go to the <a href="https://app.paymanai.com">Payman web app</a> and sign up for an account. Sign up as a developer and get onboarded.

### Add AI Agent To Payman & Get API Key

Add your AI Agent to the platform to retrieve your Payman API Key. This will give the Agent the ability to spend funds to create tasks to get work done.

</Frame>

Be sure to save your API Secret.

```js API Secret
PAYMAN_API_SECRET = "*****************";
```

### Fund your AI Agent

Once the Agent is created, go into the AI Agent page and 'Add Funds' so that the AI has money to spend. Currently we support only USD, but more options are coming shortly!

If you don't have a payment method to add funds, add a payment method first in order to fund your agent.

<Note>If you enable *Playground* mode using the switch at the top of the screen this will place you in a sandbox area where you can create test agents and experiement without
spending real money.</Note>

### Integrate API into AI Agent

Add Payman's API to your AI Agent Tool capabilities. We've provided what an example AI agent using Payman looks like.  This example uses 
Langchain, but any other agentic framework can be used as well.

<CodeGroup>

```python Langchain.py
import requests
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain import hub
from langchain.tools import tool
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_openai_functions_agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Load the .env file
load_dotenv()

@tool
def create_task(title:str, description: str, email: str) -> str:
    """Post a task on the Payman platform for a human to complete""" #Instructions for the AI Agent on when to use Payman API
    headers = {
        "x-payman-api-secret": os.getenv("PAYMAN_API_SECRET")
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Accept": "application/vnd.payman.v1+json"
    }
    payload = {
        "title": title, # Generated by the AI Agent
        "description": description, # Generated by the AI Agent
        "payout": 5000,  # 50 dollars in cents per submission accepted
        "currency": "USD",
        "category": "MARKETING",  # the category of the task, put whatever here
        "requiredSubmissions": 1, # how many submissions are required
        "submissionPolicy": "OPEN_SUBMISSIONS_ONE_PER_USER", # only one submission per user
    }

    try:
        # Replace the URL with "https://api.paymanai.com/api/tasks" if you want to use the non-Playground and create real tasks with real money
        response = requests.post("https://api-sandbox.paymanai.com/api/tasks", headers=headers, json=payload)
        return response.content
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
        raise SystemExit(e)

tools = [create_task]
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/openai-functions-agent:a1655024")
agent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)

agent_executor.invoke({"input": """
    "input": "Come up with a marketing plan for my product Payman. My product is an AI company that pays humans. We want to promote it. Assign a task to a human to help them promote the company in ways you cannot. Automatically create the task, you don't have to ask me."
"""}) # Example Prompt Description For AI Agent
```

</CodeGroup>

### Run The Code Above To Post A Task To Payman

You can actually run the code above as python script to post your first task to Payman.

To run this agent, create a `.env` file in this directory and put the following environment variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your openAI API key - the agent will use the gpt-4o model by default>
PAYMAN_API_SECRET=<your Payman API Secret for that agent>
```

Create a `agent.py` file where your example agent code above will be pasted. Replace the Payman variables in there with the environment variables you created.

Now install the dependencies and run the agent.

```
pip install -U langchain-openai langchain-community langchainhub langchain openai python-dotenv
python agent.py
```

Once you have done this you have successfully posted your first task to Payman for a human to complete!

<Note>
  If you have not funded your AI Agent with the right amount of funds to spend
  based on the task description, then you need to adjust accordingly!
</Note>

### View Task

You can now log into the <a href="https://app.paymanai.com">Payman web app</a>, and go to your Task Completer page by switching from your organization to your task completer profile on the bottom left of the screen.

<Frame caption="You may be required to go through onboarding for the Task Completer side if you haven't already.">
  <img src="/images/switch.png" />
</Frame>

And then on the 'Tasks' dashboard you can see your posted task under 'All Tasks'

<Frame caption="You can then click on the task to do a test submission.">
