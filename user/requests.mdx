## What Are Requests?

A **request** appears when a payment attempt requires **manual approval** from you.

These requests are generated when:

- A payment initiated by an agent or app **exceeds the threshold** defined in your policy
- The payment is made via:
  - An app you've connected through **OAuth**
  - A script or agent using the **Payman SDK** with your credentials

In both cases, Payman pauses the transaction and asks you to approve it.

---

## Example

Youâ€™ve set a policy with:

- Daily Limit: `$500`
- Threshold: `$100`

| Agent Action       | What Happens?            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Tries to send $50  | Auto-approved            |
| Tries to send $150 | Triggers manual request  |

## Where Do Requests Appear?

1. Go to your [Payman Dashboard](https://dashboard.paymanai.com)
2. Navigate to the **Requests** tab

Each pending request includes:
- Amount & payee
- Which agent or app triggered the request
- Option to **Approve** or **Deny**

> ðŸ’¡ You may also receive email or in-app alerts when new requests are waiting.

## Why Requests Exist

Policies are your protection layer.  
If something goes beyond what you've allowed, Payman makes sure it gets your explicit OK.

Whether it's your own SDK or a third-party app using OAuth â€” **you stay in control**.
