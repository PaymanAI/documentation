## What is a Request?

A **request** shows up when a payment needs **your approval**.

Triggered when:

-   The amount exceeds your **policy threshold**
-   Sent via an app or agent

Payman pauses the transaction until you approve or deny.

## Example

Policy:

-   Daily limit: $500
-   Threshold: $100

| Action           | Result         |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| Agent sends $50  | Auto-approved  |
| Agent sends $150 | Needs approval |

## Where to Review

1. Go to the **Requests** tab in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.paymanai.com)
2. See amount, payee, and app info
3. Click **Approve** or **Deny**

## Why This Matters

Requests ensure **you stay in control**.  
If anything exceeds your set limits, you'll always get the final sayâ€”whether it's from your own app or a third-party.
