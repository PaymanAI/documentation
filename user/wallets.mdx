## What is a Payman Wallet?

A Payman wallet is where your money lives — whether it’s USD from a bank, USDC on-chain, or test funds for development.

Payman supports **three types of wallets**:

-   **🧪 Test Wallet (TSD)** – Sandbox wallet available for testing (free)
-   **💵 USD Wallet** – Linked to a U.S. bank account via ACH  
    _($15/month subscription)_
-   **🪙 USDC Wallet** – On-chain stablecoin wallet (e.g., Polygon)  
    _($10/month subscription)_

All actions — sending, receiving, linking to agents — begin with having an active wallet.

## How to Subscribe to a Wallet

1. Log in to your [Payman Dashboard](https://app.paymanai.com)
2. Go to the **Wallets** tab
3. You’ll see 3 tabs: **TSD**, **USD**, and **USDC**
4. By default, a **TSD test wallet** is available for all users
5. To activate a USD or USDC wallet:
    - Click **Subscribe** on the desired tab
    - Complete KYC + onboarding
    - Start subscription based on your choice

Once subscribed, you can fund the wallet, send/receive money, and link it to an agent or application.

## What is a Paytag?

Every Payman wallet is assigned a unique **Paytag** — used to send or receive money.

This is your **universal identity inside Payman**.

You can:

-   Share it with others to **receive funds**
-   Use it as a destination to **send payments**
-   Authorize apps and agents to act on behalf of wallets tied to this Paytag
-   Track activity and transactions for each wallet via its Paytag

> 📎 Paytag format: `word.word.word/number`  
> _(Example: `turtle.turn.tomb/04`)_

Every wallet you create will have a unique Paytag — it’s like your wallet’s username.

## View Balances & Transactions

Once you've subscribed:

-   See **real-time balances** in your dashboard
-   Monitor **incoming/outgoing transactions**
-   Filter by wallet, date, or Paytag
-   Export activity to CSV _(coming soon)_

## Can I Have Multiple Wallets?

Yes — Payman fully supports **multiple active wallets** per user.

This gives you flexibility to:

-   Separate test, fiat, and crypto transactions
-   Assign different wallets to different agents
-   Apply unique policies per wallet (e.g., daily limits, thresholds)

Each wallet is isolated in usage, and configuration — and each has its own Paytag.
