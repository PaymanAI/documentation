## What is a Policy?

A **policy** is a rule that controls how your wallet can be used — especially when linked to your AI agent or third-party app through OAuth.

Policies ensure your money doesn’t move without your intent.

They define:

- **How much** can be spent
- **When** human approval is required

---

## System vs Custom Policies

You’ll find two kinds of policies inside your Payman dashboard:

- **System Policies** — Predefined templates like:
  - Minimalist (low trust, ultra-restricted)
  - Personal Use (light user)
  - Startup, Enterprise, Family, etc.

- **Custom Policies** — You can create your own by defining:
  - Policy name & description
  - Spend limits
  - Thresholds for triggering manual requests

> 💡 You can always **clone a system policy** to start from a template.

## Policies Are Mandatory

Anytime you connect a wallet to a third-party app (or build your own app), you must **associate a policy** with it.

Whether you’re:

- A **developer** registering your own app
- A **user** granting access to someone else’s

A policy is required to set the **rules for how your wallet will behave**.

---

## Spend Controls You Can Set

When creating a policy, you’ll be asked to define:

- **Transaction Threshold** – Amount beyond which approval is needed
- **Per Transaction Limit** – Max allowed in a single payment
- **Daily Limit** – Total allowed spend per day
- **Monthly Limit** – Cumulative cap per month

These give you fine-grained control over automated or agent-triggered payments.

## How to Create or Use a Policy

1. Open the [Payman Dashboard](https://dashboard.paymanai.com)
2. Go to **Policies**
3. Click **“Create Policy”** to start from scratch
4. Or choose from the existing **System Policies**
5. Assign the policy when:
   - Registering your app
   - Connecting a wallet via OAuth
   - Reviewing access rules

## Why It Matters

Policies are your **safety net** when agents or apps act on your behalf.

With well-defined policies:

- Routine payments go through smoothly
- Suspicious or large requests get flagged
- You retain **complete control** over your funds
