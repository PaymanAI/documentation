## What is a Policy?

A **policy** defines how much money can move from your wallet and when your approval is required.

It protects your wallet—especially when used by agents or third-party apps.

A policy sets:

-   **Spend limits** (per transaction, daily, monthly)
-   **Approval thresholds** (when manual approval is triggered)

---

## Types of Policies

-   **System Policies**  
    Predefined templates like:

    -   Minimalist
    -   Personal Use
    -   Startup, Enterprise, etc.

-   **Custom Policies**  
    You define:
    -   Name & description
    -   Spend limits
    -   Thresholds

> You can clone a system policy and customize it.

## Spend Controls

Each policy includes:

| Control             | Description                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Threshold**       | Amount above which manual approval is needed |
| **Per Transaction** | Max allowed per payment                      |
| **Daily Limit**     | Max allowed per day                          |
| **Monthly Limit**   | Max allowed per month                        |

## When Are Policies Required?

Always.  
You **must assign a policy** when:

-   Creating an agentic app
-   Connecting your wallet via OAuth
-   Letting any app act on your wallet

Without a policy, your wallet cannot be used programmatically.

---

## How to Set a Policy

1. Go to **Policies** in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.paymanai.com)
2. Click **Create Policy** or choose a system one
3. Set your limits
4. Assign the policy to your app or wallet

---

## Why It Matters

Policies are the **guardrails** for automated payments.

They make sure:

-   Small, routine transactions go through
-   Large or unexpected payments get flagged
-   You’re always in control

No wallet connected to an app can move money unless it's governed by a policy.
