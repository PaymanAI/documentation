## What is a Policy?

A **Policy** in Payman is a programmable rule set that defines **how**, **when**, and **how much** money can move from your wallet — especially when agents or third-party apps are involved.

Think of it as your **financial firewall**:
> No funds can move without matching the conditions set in your policy.

A policy helps you:

- Prevent unauthorized transfers
- Control daily/transactional limits
- Ensure approvals for high-value or unusual activity

## System Policies

Payman provides several built-in system policies designed for different use cases.

| Policy Name     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Minimalist**  | Low-trust, ultra-restricted. For cautious users or low-activity wallets.    |
| **Personal Use**| Light usage — for individuals with basic recurring payments or automation.  |
| **Professional**| Balanced flexibility and control for freelancers or contractors.            |
| **Startup**     | Designed for small teams managing payouts, expenses, or business ops.       |
| **Enterprise**  | High-volume, high-trust accounts with human oversight.                      |
| **Family**      | Moderate flexibility, but approval required for high-value transactions.    |

> You can **clone and customize** any system policy to fit your needs.

## Custom Policies

You can also create your own policies from scratch.

Customizable fields include:

- **Policy name & description**

- **Spend limits**

## Spend Controls

Each policy defines the following limits:

| Control             | Description                                                               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Threshold**       | Amount above which manual approval is needed                              |
| **Per Transaction** | Maximum amount allowed per single payment                                 |
| **Daily Limit**     | Maximum total amount allowed per day                                      |
| **Monthly Limit**   | Maximum total amount allowed per month                                    |

> 🔍 **Threshold vs Approval**  
> The **threshold** is the point at which your **approval** is required.  
> For example: if your threshold is ₹1,000, any payment above that will trigger a manual approval request.

## When Are Policies Required?

Always.

You **must assign a policy** when:

- Creating an AI agent or app
- Connecting a wallet via OAuth
- Letting any automation act on your wallet

No policy = no access. Policies are mandatory for any programmatic money movement.

---

## How to Set a Policy

1. Go to the **Policies** tab in the [Payman Dashboard](https://dashboard.paymanai.com)
2. Click **Create Policy**, or select a system policy
3. Set spend limits and thresholds
4. Assign the policy to your app, agent, or wallet
5. Done — your wallet is now protected by programmable rules

---

## Cloning & Customizing Policies

System policies are not editable directly — but you can **clone** any of them and tailor it to your needs.

Once cloned, you can:

- Change the name and description
- Adjust spend limits and thresholds
- Apply it to any wallet or app you own

Cloned policies are private to your account or organization.

---

## Why It Matters

Policies are your **guardrails**. They make sure:

- Small or routine payments flow automatically
- Unusual or high-risk transactions are paused for approval
- Your wallet stays safe — even with autonomous agents involved

> No wallet connected to an app or agent can move money unless it's governed by a policy.
