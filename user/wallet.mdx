-   **USDC Wallet**: For real payments using USDC (a stablecoin). Available to both **US and international developers**.
-   **TSD Wallet (Test)**: For testing with 1000 TSD.

## How to Access Wallets

Before using wallets, you need to:

1. **Request an Invite Code**  
   _(Payman is invite-only to ensure secure onboarding.)_

2. **Register on the [Payman Dashboard](https://app.paymanai.com)**

3. **Access the Wallets Section** from the dashboard

4. **Enable Developer Mode** (optional, for accessing TSD test wallets)

5. **Choose a Wallet Type** (USD or USDC for live usage)

6. **Complete KYC Verification**  
   _(Involves verifying your identity with documents like a government-issued ID.)_

7. Once verified, your wallet is **live and ready to use**

Think of it like your wallet handle â€” you can:

-   Send or receive funds
-   Assign wallets to AI agents
-   Track and trace transactions

---

## View Balances & Transactions

From the Dashboard, you can:

-   See real-time wallet balances
-   View detailed transaction history
-   Filter, sort, and export transaction logs

---

## Managing Multiple Wallets

You can create and manage multiple wallets to:

-   Assign each to different agents or apps
-   Apply unique policies to each wallet
-   Separate test (TSD), USD, and USDC flows
-   Rename wallets as needed
