## Wallet Types

When you sign up, you get a **TSD test wallet** with 1000 TSD for sandbox testing.

To use real money:

-   **USD Wallet** (US users, via ACH)
-   **USDC Wallet** (International users, on-chain)

## How to Use Live Wallets

1. Log in to [Payman Dashboard](https://app.paymanai.com)
2. Request **Invite Code**
3. Go to **Wallets** Section
4. Choose the type of wallet you want to use (USD or USDC)
5. Complete KYC
6. Your wallet is ready to use

## Test vs Live Wallets

| Type        | Purpose         | Currency | Notes                          |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| TSD Wallet  | Sandbox testing | TSD      | Auto-created on signup         |
| USD Wallet  | Real payments   | USD      | For US users (ACH)             |
| USDC Wallet | Real payments   | USDC     | International users (on-chain) |

## Paytag

Each wallet has a **Paytag** (e.g. `turtle.turn.tomb/04`)  
Use it to:

-   Send/receive funds
-   Link wallets to agents
-   Track transactions

## View Balances

From the dashboard, you can:

-   See wallet balances
-   View all transactions
-   Filter and export history

## Multiple Wallets

You can have multiple wallets and:

-   Assign them to different agents
-   Set different policies for each
-   Separate test, USD, and USDC flows
