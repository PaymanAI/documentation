## What is a Payee?

A **payee** is anyone you send money to — a bank account, crypto wallet, or test account.

Payman supports:

-   **Bank Account (ACH)** – US-based routing/account number
-   **Crypto Address** – USDC wallets (e.g. Ethereum, Polygon)
-   **Test Account** – For TSD test payments

## Add a Payee

1. Go to the **Payees** tab in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.paymanai.com)
2. Click **Add New Payee**
3. Choose type: ACH, Crypto, or Test
4. Fill in details → Save

Once added, the payee is ready to use for transactions.

## Manage Payees

-   View, edit, or remove from the Payees tab
-   Each payee has a unique ID
-   Payees are reusable across wallets and agents

> Payees must be added before any payment can be made using the SDK or dashboard.
