## What Is a Payee?

A **payee** is the recipient of your payment — this could be a person, a business, a crypto wallet, or a test account.

Payman supports **three types of payees**:

-   **Bank Account (US ACH)** — For U.S. bank accounts using account & routing numbers
-   **Crypto Address** — For sending USDC to on-chain wallets (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon)
-   **Test Account** — For sending mock payments using TSD wallets (sandbox only)

You can save payees and reuse them across payments and automations.
