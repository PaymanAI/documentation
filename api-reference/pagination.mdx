Many of the API endpoints which return lists do so in a paginated fashion.  Whenever this is the case, there are two key query parameters which may be included.  These are:

- `page`: This is the index of the page to fetch, starting at 0
- `limit`: The number of items to fetch per page, limited to 100

The response from any such queries will be of the format:

```js
{
  results: any[], //the list of results objects in the queried page
  more: boolean, //true if there are more results after this page, and false otherwise
  nextPage: number, //the next page index (which can be added to the `page` attribute for the next query)
}
```
