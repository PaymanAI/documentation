## Installation

Install the Payman Python SDK using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install paymanai
```

```bash poetry
poetry add paymanai
```

```bash pipenv
pipenv install paymanai
```

</CodeGroup>

## Configuration

To use the SDK, you'll need to initialize it with your API key. You can find your API key in the [Payman Dashboard](https://app.paymanai.com/dashboard/api-keys).

```python
from paymanai import Paymanai

payman = Paymanai(
    x_payman_api_secret='your_api_key',  # Your API key from the dashboard
    environment='sandbox'  # Use 'production' for live transactions
)
```

<Note>
  Make sure to use `environment='sandbox'` while testing. Switch to `'production'` only when you're ready to process real transactions.
</Note>

## Making Your First API Call

Here's a simple example of creating a payment destination:

```python
try:
    payee = payman.payments.create_payee(
        type='US_ACH',
        name='John Doe',
        account_holder_name='John Doe',
        account_number='1234567890',
        routing_number='011000138',
        account_type='checking'
    )
    print(f"Created payee: {payee.id}")
except PaymanError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e.message}")
```

## Error Handling

The SDK uses standard Python exceptions for error handling:

```python
from paymanai.errors import PaymanError

try:
    payment = payman.payments.send_payment(
        amount_decimal=100.00,
        payment_destination_id='dest_123'
    )
except PaymanError as e:
    if e.code == 'insufficient_funds':
        print('Not enough funds available')
    elif e.code == 'invalid_destination':
        print('Payment destination is invalid')
    else:
        print(f'An error occurred: {e.message}')
```

## Type Hints

The SDK includes comprehensive type hints for better IDE support and code safety:

```python
from paymanai.types import PaymentDestination, PaymentResponse
from typing import Optional

def process_payment(
    amount: float,
    destination_id: str,
    memo: Optional[str] = None
) -> PaymentResponse:
    return payman.payments.send_payment(
        amount_decimal=amount,
        payment_destination_id=destination_id,
        memo=memo
    )
```
