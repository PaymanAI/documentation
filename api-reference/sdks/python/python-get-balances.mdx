description: "Get how much your AI Agent can spend (per agent or per customer)"

## Check Balances

Two simple endpoints to check available balances - one for your customers and one for your AI Agent.

```python
from paymanai import Paymanai

client = Paymanai(
    x_payman_api_secret=os.getenv("PAYMAN_API_SECRET"),
    environment="sandbox"
)

# Get a customer's balance
customer_balance = client.balances.get_customer_balance(
    "cust_123",  # customer ID
    "USD"        # currency
)

# Get your AI Agent's balance
agent_balance = client.balances.get_spendable_balance(
    "USD"  # currency
)
```

## What gets returned

Both endpoints return a float representing the spendable balance in the currency's units:

```python
1.01  # means 1.01 USD
```

The balance only includes funds that:

- Have been verified as received
- Aren't reserved for other tasks

## Parameters

For Customer Balance:

- `customer_id`: Either:
  - Your system's customer ID
  - Payman's customer ID
- `currency`: Currency code (e.g., "USD")

For Agent Balance:

- `currency`: Currency code (e.g., "USD")

### Using Type Hints

```python
from decimal import Decimal
from typing import Union

def get_customer_funds(
    customer_id: str,
    currency: str = "USD"
) -> Union[float, Decimal]:
    return client.balances.get_customer_balance(
        customer_id,
        currency
    )

# Example usage with error handling
try:
    balance = get_customer_funds("cust_123")
    print(f"Available balance: ${balance:.2f}")
except PaymanError as e:
    print(f"Failed to get balance: {e.message}")
```

### Handling Multiple Currencies

```python
def check_all_balances(customer_id: str) -> dict:
    currencies = ["USD", "USDC"]
    balances = {}

    for currency in currencies:
        try:
            balance = client.balances.get_customer_balance(
                customer_id,
                currency
            )
            balances[currency] = balance
        except PaymanError:
            balances[currency] = 0.0

    return balances

# Example usage
balances = check_all_balances("cust_123")
for currency, amount in balances.items():
    print(f"{currency}: {amount}")
```
