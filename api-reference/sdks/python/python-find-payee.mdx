Search for existing payment destinations. This is a simple `GET` request that returns a list of matching destinations.

You can search just by simply putting in the name and the search will return a list of potential payees. You may also just leave it empty and it will return all.

```python
from paymanai import Paymanai

client = Paymanai(
    x_payman_api_secret=os.getenv("PAYMAN_API_SECRET"),
    environment="sandbox"
)

# Get all destinations
all_destinations = client.payments.search_destinations()

# Or filter with optional parameters
filtered_destinations = client.payments.search_destinations(
    name="John",  # Partial match works
    contact_email="john@example.com",
    type="US_ACH"
)
```

## Response returned

```python
[
    {
        "id": "dest_123abc",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "type": "US_ACH",
        "organization_id": "org_xyz",
        "status": "ACTIVE",
        "contact_details": {
            "contact_type": "individual",
            "email": "john@example.com",
            "phone_number": "+1234567890",
            "address": "123 Main St",
            "tax_id": "123-45-6789"
        },
        "tags": ["primary"]
    },
    # ... more destinations
]
```

### Search Filters

Filter results by including any of these parameters:

- `name`: Partial match for destination name
- `account_number`: Bank account number
- `routing_number`: Bank routing number
- `contact_email`: Email address
- `contact_phone_number`: Phone number
- `contact_tax_id`: Tax ID
- `type`: "US_ACH" or "CRYPTO_ADDRESS"

### Using Type Hints

```python
from paymanai.types import PaymentDestination
from typing import List, Optional

def search_destinations(
    name: Optional[str] = None,
    contact_email: Optional[str] = None
) -> List[PaymentDestination]:
    return client.payments.search_destinations(
        name=name,
        contact_email=contact_email
    )

# Example usage
destinations = search_destinations(name="John")
for dest in destinations:
    print(f"Found: {dest.name} ({dest.id})")
```

### Error Handling

```python
try:
    destinations = client.payments.search_destinations(
        name="John",
        type="US_ACH"
    )
    if not destinations:
        print("No destinations found")
    else:
        for dest in destinations:
            print(f"Found destination: {dest.name}")
except PaymanError as e:
    print(f"Search failed: {e.message}")
```
