description: "Get how much your AI Agent can spend (per agent or per customer)"

## Check Balances

Two simple endpoints to check available balances - one for your customers and one for your AI Agent.

```typescript
const client = new Paymanai({
  xPaymanAPISecret: process.env["PAYMAN_API_SECRET"],
  environment: "sandbox",
});

// Get a customer's balance
const customerBalance = await client.balances.getCustomerBalance(
  "cust_123", // customer ID
  "USD" // currency
);

// Get your AI Agent's balance
const agentBalance = await client.balances.getSpendableBalance(
  "USD" // currency
);
```

## What gets returned

Both endpoints return a number representing the spendable balance in the currency's units:

```typescript
1.01; // means 1.01 USD
```

The balance only includes funds that:

- Have been verified as received
- Aren't reserved for other tasks

## Parameters

For Customer Balance:

- `customerId`: Either:

  - Your system's customer ID
  - Payman's customer ID

- currency: Currency code (e.g., "USD")

For Agent Balance:

- currency: Currency code (e.g. "USD")
