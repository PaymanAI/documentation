Search for existing payment destinations. This is a simple `GET` request that returns an array of matching destinations.

You can search just by simply putting in the name and the search will return a list of potential payees. You may also just leave it empty and it will return all.

```typescript
const client = new Paymanai({
  xPaymanAPISecret: process.env["PAYMAN_API_SECRET"],
  environment: "sandbox",
});

// Get all destinations
const allDestinations = await client.payments.searchDestinations();

// Or filter with optional parameters
const filteredDestinations = await client.payments.searchDestinations({
  name: "John", // Partial match works
  contactEmail: "john@example.com",
  type: "US_ACH",
});
```

## Response returned

```typescript
[
  {
    id: "dest_123abc",
    name: "John Doe",
    type: "US_ACH",
    organizationId: "org_xyz",
