## API Keys

The Payman API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You must include your API key in the `x-payman-api-secret` header for all requests:

```bash
'x-payman-api-secret: your_api_key'
```

## Test vs Live Mode

API keys are environment-specific:
- Test mode keys work with the sandbox environment
- Live mode keys work with the production environment

```bash
# Test mode endpoint
https://agent-sandbox.payman.ai/api

# Live mode endpoint
https://agent.payman.ai/api
```

Test mode provides a sandbox environment with simulated funds for development and testing.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Sign up at [Payman Dashboard](https://app.paymanai.com)
2. Navigate to AI Agents â†’ Your Agent
3. Click "Regenerate Credentials"

<Note>
  Your API key will only be shown once. Store it securely as you'll need to generate a new one if lost.
</Note>

## Security Best Practices

- Never share your API key in public repositories
- Don't expose keys in client-side code
- Use environment variables to store keys
- Rotate keys if compromised
- Use test mode for development

## Request Example

```bash
curl https://agent.payman.ai/api/payments/send-payment \
  -H "x-payman-api-secret: your_api_key" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.payman.v1+json" \
  -d '{
    "paymentDestinationId": "dest_123",
    "amountDecimal": 50.00
  }'
```

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "status": 401,
  "errorCode": "not_authorized",
  "message": "Invalid API key provided",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-22T10:00:00Z"
}
```
