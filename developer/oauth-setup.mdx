Payman OAuth allows your users to **securely link their wallets** to your application — without exposing credentials.

It enables you to:
- Authenticate users
- Access their wallet balances
- Send payments on their behalf (within defined policies)

---

## Step 1: Fill OAuth Config

Inside your registered app → **OAuth Config** tab, fill out the following:

- **Purpose**  
  Describe why your app needs Payman access  
  _(e.g. “This AI agent automates bill payments for users.”)_

- **Required URLs**
  - **Privacy URL**
  - **Terms of Service URL**
  - **Redirect URLs**  
    Where users will land after authentication

- **Originating Domains**  
  Domains from which your frontend will initiate the OAuth request

---

## Step 2: Select Scopes

Choose only what your app needs:

- `read:balance`
- `write:send_payment`
- `write:create_payee`
- `read:list_wallets`
- etc.

Users will see these permissions during the consent flow.

---

## Step 3: Add Limits (Required)

You must also define:
- **Per Transaction Limit**
- **Daily Limit**
- **Monthly Limit**
- **Threshold**  
  _(When exceeded, manual approval is required)_

> These enforce how much money your app can request to move via user policies.

---

## Step 4: Submit OAuth Request

Once filled:
- Click **Submit OAuth Request**
- Your app will be reviewed and approved by Payman Admins

Once approved, you’ll be able to use the full OAuth flow to link wallets.
