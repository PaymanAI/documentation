Payman allows you to configure **webhooks** so your application can receive real-time updates when key events occur.

Use this to:
- Confirm payment status
- Monitor balance changes
- Track agent activity for compliance

## Set Up a Webhook

2. Enter your **Webhook Endpoint URL**  
   Example: `https://your-domain.com/payman/webhook`
3. (Optional) Click **Add Headers** for custom keys (like secrets or tokens)

Once configured, Payman will start sending event payloads to your endpoint.
