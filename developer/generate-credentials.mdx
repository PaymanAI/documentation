## Where to Find Credentials

After registering your app, go to the **Credentials** tab. You’ll see:

-   **Test Credentials** — For TSD wallets (sandbox only)
-   **Live Credentials** — For real USD/USDC transactions

---

## How to Generate

1. Click **Generate Live Credentials**
2. Copy:
    - **Client ID**
    - **Client Secret** (shown once)

Store them securely — use only in your backend.

> Lost your secret? Revoke and re-generate from the dashboard.

## Test vs Live

| Type | Use Case                | Wallet   | Notes            |
| ---- | ----------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Test | Development & testing   | TSD      | Dummy funds only |
| Live | Production transactions | USD/USDC | Sends real money |

Use separate credentials per environment.
