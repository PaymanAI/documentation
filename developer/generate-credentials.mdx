## Where to Find Your Credentials

Once your app is registered, go to the **Credentials** tab inside the app.

You'll see two types:

### 1. **Test Credentials**

-   For testing with sandbox wallets (TSD accounts, dummy funds)
-   Good for early development

### 2. **Live Credentials**

-   Used to send real money from USD / USDC wallets
-   Requires proper wallet and payee configuration

## How to Generate Credentials

1. Click **“Generate Live Credentials”**
2. Copy both:
    - **Client ID**
    - **Client Secret** (only shown once)

Save these in a secure backend environment.

> Lost your secret? Delete and re-generate new credentials from the dashboard.

## Switching Between Test and Live

You can generate and use **both environments** independently:

-   Test = staging agent + sandbox funds
-   Live = production agent + real money

Use different credentials for each environment.
