To integrate Payman into your product, you must first **register your app** and configure access.

---

## Step 1: Enable Developer Mode

On your [Payman Dashboard](https://dashboard.paymanai.com):
- Toggle the **“Developers”** switch in the sidebar

This unlocks the **Apps** section where you can register and manage developer credentials.

---

## Step 2: Register Your App

1. Go to **Apps → Register App**
2. Fill in:
   - App Name
   - Description
   - (Optional) Website

Click **Save** to create the app.

---

## Step 3: App Configuration

Each app must be linked to:
- A **Wallet** (or allow "all wallets")
- One or more **Payees**
- Exactly **one Policy**

> 🔐 **One App = One Policy**

This determines how much money the app is allowed to move, based on daily/monthly limits and thresholds.

You can:
- Choose a **system policy** (like `sys-minimalist-policy`)
- Or create a custom one in the **Policies** tab

---

## What Happens After Registration?

You'll see **4 tabs** in your app:

1. **Overview** – app info + config summary
2. **Credentials** – where you generate Client ID / Secret
3. **Webhooks** – set callback URLs (optional)
4. **OAuth Config** – setup Sign In with Payman (if needed)

Continue to the next section to generate credentials.
