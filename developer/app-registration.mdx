## Why Register an App?

Registering an app allows you to **automate payments, manage wallets, and interact with Payman via SDK**.

Each app gets a unique set of credentials, access control via policies, OAuth access and full visibility into payment activity — ensuring secure and governed automation.

---

## Step 1: Enable Developer Mode

In the [Payman Dashboard](https://app.paymanai.com), toggle the **"Developers"** switch in the sidebar.

This unlocks:

-   Ability to register apps
-   Access to **TSD wallets** for testing

---

## Step 2: Register the App

1. Go to **Apps → Register App**
2. Enter the following details:
    - **App Name**
    - **Description**
    - (Optional) **Website**
3. Click **Save**
![Register App](/images/register-apps/img_2.png)
You’ll now see your app listed and ready to configure.

---

## Step 3: Configure the App

Each app must be connected to:

-   **At least One Wallet**  
    Select a specific wallet or allow access to all.

-   **At least one Payee**  
    Choose who this app can send money to — bank accounts, wallets, or test payees.

-   **One Policy (required)**  
    Every app must be governed by a policy that defines limits, thresholds, and approval rules.

<Info> **One App = One Policy** 
You can choose a system policy or clone/customize your own in the **Policies** tab.</Info>

## After Registration

Once your app is saved and configured, you’ll see 5 tabs in the app view:

| Tab              | Purpose                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overview**     | Basic details, configuration summary, app status      |
| **Credentials**  | Generate **Client ID** and **Client Secret**          |
| **Webhooks**     | (Optional) Add callback URLs to receive event updates |
| **OAuth Config** | (Optional) Set up Payman OAuth for third-party access |
| **Playground**   | Test your app’s configuration                         |

You can generate both **Test Credentials** (TSD wallet) and **Live Credentials** (USD/USDC wallets) once your app is ready and linked to an approved policy.

---

## Playground

The **Playground** tab allows you to **test your app's configuration and authentication flows** right from the dashboard — no Postman or code needed.

It supports both:

-   **Client Credentials Flow**: For backend automation
-   **Authorization Code Flow**: For apps that use Payman OAuth to access wallets on behalf of end users


---

## What's Next?

Once your app is registered:

-   Use the **Payman TypeScript SDK** to start building
-   Use your **credentials** to authenticate and send payments
-   Monitor activity and logs via the dashboard
