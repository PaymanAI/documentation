<Note>
	To use Payman programmatically, you must register your app and link it to a
	wallet, payees, and a policy.
</Note>

## Step 1: Enable Developer Mode

In the [Dashboard](https://app.paymanai.com), toggle the **“Developers”** switch in the sidebar to unlock developer features.

---

## Step 2: Register the App

1. Go to **Apps → Register App**
2. Enter:
    - App Name
    - Description
    - (Optional) Website
3. Click **Save**

---

## Step 3: Configure the App

Each app must be linked to:

-   A specific **Wallet** (or allow all)
-   One or more **Payees**
-   **One Policy** (required)

> One app = one policy.  
> This defines how much money the app can move and when approval is needed.

Choose a system policy or create a custom one in **Policies**.

## After Registration

You’ll see 4 tabs in your app view:

| Tab              | Purpose                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Overview**     | App details and setup summary  |
| **Credentials**  | Generate Client ID and Secret  |
| **Webhooks**     | (Optional) Add callback URLs   |
| **OAuth Config** | (Optional) Set up Payman OAuth |

Once registered and configured, proceed to generate credentials and start using the SDK.
