## What is the Playground?

The **Payman Playground** lets you test your app's authentication and configuration — right inside the dashboard — without needing to write any code.

It supports both:

-   **Client Credentials Flow** – for backend apps or AI agents
-   **OAuth Authorization Code Flow** – for apps using Payman OAuth with end users

## Why Use It?

-   Instantly test if your app, policy, wallet, and payees are linked correctly
-   Generate access tokens before writing integration code
-   Debug credential errors without needing Postman or custom scripts

> ✅ The Playground is the fastest way to verify your app setup before moving to SDK or API calls.

---

## How to Use It

1. Go to your app in the dashboard
2. Click the **Playground** tab
3. Choose a **Grant Type**:
    - `Client Credentials`
    - `Authorization Code`
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** (from the Credentials tab)
5. Click **Connect**

If your credentials are valid, you'll see a success response and your app is ready to be used programmatically.

<Info>
	You can now choose which agent you want to get responses from in the
	Playground. Use the 'Available Agents' panel on the right to select your
	preferred agent before sending a prompt.

## Common Use Cases

-   Test new app configurations before calling `.ask()` in the SDK
-   Validate that your wallet and policy are correctly linked
-   Debug OAuth integrations with real auth codes
