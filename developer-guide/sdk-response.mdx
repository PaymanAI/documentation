When you call `payman.ask()` in your code, you receive a structured response object. This object contains not only the main answer to your prompt, but also useful metadata for tracking, auditing, and advanced workflows.

## Example Response

Here is a real-world example of a response you might get from the SDK:

```json
{
	"taskId": "tsk-5085db82-caa4-4f6a-a7d6-95a610eefe40",
	"requestId": "req-3f9454d6-6d2a-4df7-ad24-fe81fcb538e6",
	"sessionId": "ses-e4a71cad-9e5a-4333-8db4-acd8ff74987d",
	"status": "COMPLETED",
	"statusMessage": "Processing completed successfully",
	"timestamp": "2025-06-27T16:31:41.510422505Z",
	"artifacts": [
		{
			"name": "response",
			"description": "AI Assistant Response",
			"content": "Here's a summary of your wallets and their current balances:\n\n1. AAHI Agent Wallet (paytag: tube.tense.cask/53)\n   - Spendable Balance: $989.99\n   - Pending Balance: $0.00\n   - Currency: TSD\n\n2. Demo Wallet (paytag: kite.flap.halo/88)\n   - Spendable Balance: $969.97\n   - Pending Balance: $0.00\n   - Currency: TSD\n\n3. TSD Wallet (paytag: adverb.exasperate.dust/74)\n   - Spendable Balance: $964.96\n   - Pending Balance: $0.00\n   - Currency: TSD\n\nAll wallets are in TSD currency with no pending transactions. Is there anything specific you would like to do with these wallets?",
			"type": "text",
			"timestamp": "2025-06-27T16:31:41.584Z",
			"metadata": {}
		}
	],
	"metadata": {
		"timestamp": "2025-06-27T16:31:30.892Z",
		"agentId": "ai-1f042092-f548-6635-8646-6f0238b93691",
		"orgId": "org-1efef51b-02c3-6bbd-894e-4324bac0f4d1"
	}
}
```

## Key Fields

-   **content** (inside `artifacts`):

    <Info>
    	This is the main answer to your prompt. For most use cases, you will
    	display or process this field in your app.
    </Info>

-   **status**: Indicates if the request was completed, failed, or is still in progress.
-   **sessionId**: Used to track and resume conversations or workflows.
-   **taskId** and **requestId**: Useful for debugging, logging, or support.
-   **metadata**: Contains additional context about the agent, organization, and timestamps.

## How to Use the Response

In your code, you typically want to extract the main answer from the first artifact:

```python
response = client.ask("Show my wallet balances")
main_content = response['artifacts'][0]['content']
print(main_content)
```

<Tip>
	If you use streaming, you will receive updates to the artifacts as they are
	generated. For most synchronous use cases, just use the first artifact's
	`content`.
</Tip>

---

<Note>
	If you need to debug or audit, you can log the full response object. For
	most user-facing features, just show the `content` field.
</Note>{" "}
