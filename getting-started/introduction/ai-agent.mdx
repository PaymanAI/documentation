## Introduction

An AI Agent is a software program that works on your behalf to complete tasks based on goals you set. It observes information, makes decisions on its own, and takes actions to accomplish objectives. Unlike basic AI tools that only provide recommendations, an agent can execute tasks independently. It learns from its experiences and adapts its approach to better achieve the goals you've defined.

<Note>
	The key difference between AI Agents and traditional tools is autonomy -
	they can make decisions and take actions without continuous human guidance.

<Steps>
	<Step title='Gathering Information' stepNumber={1} icon='eye'>
		The agent collects data from various sources - this might be your
		question, information from websites, or data you've provided. Think of
		this as the agent's "eyes and ears" that help it understand what needs
		to be done.
	</Step>
	<Step title='Processing and Decision Making' stepNumber={2} icon='brain'>
		Using powerful AI models (like large language models), the agent
		analyzes the information and determines the best approach. It weighs
		different options and plans out the steps needed to complete your task
		successfully.
	</Step>
	<Step title='Taking Action' stepNumber={3} icon='rocket'>
		Unlike basic AI tools that just give suggestions, an agent actually
		performs the tasks. It might send messages, search for information,
		create content, or interact with other systems to get things done for
		you.
	</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
	The beauty of AI agents is their ability to work independently once you set
	a goal. They follow this **sense-think-act** cycle continuously, adapting as
	needed until they accomplish what you've asked them to do - all without
	requiring your constant guidance for each step.
