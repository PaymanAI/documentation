## Webhooks: Real-time Payment Events

Stay informed about payment activities with our webhook system.

### Event Types

Payman webhooks notify you about important events like:

-   Customer deposits (pending, successful, failed)
-   Low balance alerts
-   Payment approvals and rejections

---

## RESTful APIs

Payman offers comprehensive RESTful APIs that give you direct access to all payment functionality:

```bash
curl https://agent.payman.ai/api/payments/send-payment \
  -H "x-payman-api-secret: sk_test_..." \
  -d '{
    "paymentDestinationId": "dest_123",
    "amountDecimal": 50.00,
    "memo": "Service payment"
  }'
```

### Key Endpoints

-   **POST /payments/send-payment** - Transfer funds to payment destinations
-   **POST /payments/create-payee** - Add new payment destinations
-   **POST /payments/generate-deposit-link** - Create customer deposit links
-   **GET /payments/search-payees** - Find existing payment destinations
-   **GET /accounts/spendable-balance** - Check available funds
-   **GET /accounts/customer-wallet-balance** - View customer wallet balance

### Authentication

All API requests require authentication using the `x-payman-api-secret` header:

```bash
'x-payman-api-secret: sk_test_...'
```

### Sandbox vs Production

Payman provides separate environments for development and live transactions:

#### Production
https://agent.payman.ai/api

#### Sandbox
https://agent-sandbox.payman.ai/api
