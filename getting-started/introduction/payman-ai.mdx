## Introduction

Payman AI is the specialized financial infrastructure that empowers AI Agents to move money securely and efficiently. With built-in compliance, human oversight, and seamless integration, it's the foundation that developers need to trust AI with financial transactions. Payman bridges the critical gap between autonomous AI capabilities and real-world financial operations.

<Note>
	Payman AI doesn't require AI to have full autonomy - just the right
	financial tools with appropriate safeguards and controls.
