![Introducing Payman](/images/intro.png)

# Meet Payman

> **Payman lets your AI agents move money.** Safely. On autopilot. With rules you control.

Whether you're building an AI assistant, an automated payroll system, or a bot that tips users, Payman gives you the building blocks:

-   **Wallets**
-   **Payees**
-   **Policies**
-   Our core function: `payman.ask()`

---

## Why Does Payman Exist?

<Info>
	AI-first world, agents also need to take action like _"send $100 to John"_
	or _"create a new payee for this vendor"_. That's where Payman comes in.
</Info>

Think of Payman as the **secure financial layer** between your AI and your money.

## The Magic of `payman.ask()`

<Tip>
	This is the star of the show. You send **natural language instructions**,
	and the Payman Agent turns them into real actions like:
</Tip>

```ts
await payman.ask("Send $15 to Alice with note 'thanks for lunch'");
```

It will:

-   ✅ Create a payee
-   ✅ Check your wallet balance
-   ✅ Apply policies
-   ✅ Trigger payment
-   ✅ Send a response back — all in one line

## Built for Everyone: Dashboard + SDK

You can use Payman through:

-   🖥️ **A simple dashboard** — no code needed
-   🧑‍💻 **SDKs (TypeScript & Python)** — for total programmatic control
