## One Function. Infinite Power.

`payman.ask()` is how your AI agent interacts with money — using **natural language**.

You send a message like:

```ts
await payman.ask("Send $10 to Jane for lunch");
```

And Payman handles the rest:

-   Creates or looks up the payee
-   Applies wallet and policy rules
-   Sends the payment (if allowed)
-   Returns a structured response

It's like having a finance team inside a single function.

## Examples You Can Use

<Info>These all work in both test mode (TSD) and live wallets.</Info>

**Send a payment**

```ts
await payman.ask("Send $5 to Kevin for snacks");
```

**Create a new payee**

```ts
await payman.ask("Add a payee named Riya with USDC wallet 0xabc...");
```

**Check balance**

```ts
await payman.ask("What's my balance in the USD wallet?");
```

**Trigger policy approval**

```ts
await payman.ask("Send $5000 to Marketing budget");
```

<Tip>
	If this exceeds your daily or per-payment limit, the request will be flagged
	for approval — based on your wallet's policy.
</Tip>

## What's Happening Under the Hood?

Each time you call `payman.ask()`, the following happens:

1. 🔍 **Intent Parsing** — The message is sent to the Payman Agent, which understands what action is being requested.
2. 🧠 **Policy Evaluation** — The agent checks your wallet's limits and spending rules.
3. 🧾 **Execution or Request** — If allowed, the action happens instantly. If not, it's queued for user approval.
4. ✅ **Structured Response** — You get a JSON response detailing what happened (or what needs approval).
