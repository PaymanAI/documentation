## Overview

This comprehensive guide will walk you through obtaining, managing, and securing your Payman AI API credentials. A properly configured API key is essential for connecting your applications to the Payman platform.

## Creating Your Payman Account

<Note>
	Creating a Payman AI account is free. You only pay for transactions when
	using the production environment.
</Note>
Before you can get an API key, you'll need to create a Payman AI account:

1. Visit the [Payman AI Dashboard](https://app.paymanai.com)

2. Click the **Register Here** button. (If you already have an account, simply **Sign In** to access Payman Dashboard)

3. Enter your details:

    - First & Last Name
    - Email address
    - Password (at least 8 characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols)

4. Verify your email address through the confirmation link sent to your inbox and then **SIGN IN**

5. Complete your profile setup!

6. When you Sign In, you will automatically be in the **Developer Mode** or **Sandbox** and **$1,000** in test funds will be added to your account

<Warning>
	Always test your implementation thoroughly in Developer Mode before moving
	to production. This helps identify integration issues without any financial
	risk.
</Warning>

## Generating Your API Key

Follow these steps to generate your API key:

1. In the Payman AI Dashboard, locate the left sidebar menu

2. Navigate to **AI Agents â†’ Default Agent**

3. In the Agent settings page, locate the **API Key** section:

4. Click the **Regenerate API Key** button

5. A modal will appear with your newly generated API key:

<Frame caption='API key generation modal'>
	<img src='/images/api-key-secret.png' />
</Frame>

6. Click the **Copy** button next to your API key to copy it to your clipboard

<Warning>
	For security reasons, your API key is shown only once during generation.
	Make sure to copy it immediately and store it securely. If you lose access
	to your key, you'll need to generate a new one.
</Warning>

## Securely Storing Your API Key

Properly securing your API key is critical for protecting your account:

### DOs

-   Store API keys in environment variables
-   Use a secure password manager for backup
-   Implement proper access controls within your organization
-   Rotate keys periodically (every 3-6 months)

### DON'Ts

-   Hardcode API keys in your application code
-   Store keys in public repositories
-   Include keys in client-side JavaScript
-   Share keys via email or messaging apps
-   Expose keys in public-facing error logs

---

## Environment Variables Setup

**Node.js/.env file:**

```
PAYMAN_API_SECRET=your_api_key_here
PAYMAN_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
```

**Docker:**

```bash
docker run -e PAYMAN_API_SECRET=your_api_key_here -e PAYMAN_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox your-image
```

**GitHub Actions (Secrets):**

```yaml
steps:
    - name: Run API tests
      env:
          PAYMAN_API_SECRET: ${{ secrets.PAYMAN_API_SECRET }}
          PAYMAN_ENVIRONMENT: sandbox
      run: npm test
```

---

## Switching to Production

When you're ready to process real transactions:

1. Toggle Developer Mode to **OFF** in the dashboard navigation bar

2. Confirm that you want to switch to the Production environment

3. Update your application's environment variable:

    ```
    PAYMAN_ENVIRONMENT=production
    ```

4. Conduct a small test transaction to verify production functionality

<Warning>
	In production mode, all transactions involve real money. Ensure your
	implementation is thoroughly tested in the sandbox environment before
	switching to production.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting API Key Issues

If you encounter issues with your API key:

### Invalid Key Errors

-   Verify you're using the most recently generated API key
-   Check for accidental whitespace or line breaks in the key
-   Ensure you're sending the key in the correct header format: `x-payman-api-secret: your_key_here`

### Authentication Failed

-   Confirm you're using the correct environment (sandbox vs. production)
-   Check if your account has proper permissions
-   Verify your account is in good standing

### Rate Limiting

-   If you receive `429 Too Many Requests` errors, you may be exceeding API rate limits
-   Implement exponential backoff in your request handling
-   Contact support if you need increased rate limits
