- No additional fees

### Credit/Debit Card (US)
- Instant funding
- Major cards accepted
- Standard processing fees apply

## Dashboard Setup

1. Navigate to [Funding Sources](https://app.paymanai.com/dashboard/funding)
2. Click "Add Funding Source"
3. Choose your preferred method
4. Complete secure verification

## Security

- PCI-compliant card processing
- Automated fraud monitoring
- Separate agent and funding systems

  Your financial details stay private. AI Agents can only access their available balance, never your funding sources.
