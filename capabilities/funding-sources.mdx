## Human-Controlled AI Funding

Payman provides a secure way to fund your AI Agent's activities while keeping your financial information completely separate from the AI. Your funding sources are never accessible to the AI - only you can initiate transfers.

### Link Your Funding Source

Add funds to your AI Agent's wallet through the Payman dashboard using:

- ACH Bank Transfer (US only)
  - Link your bank account securely
  - 1-3 business days for transfers
  - No fees for standard transfers
- Credit/Debit Card
  - Instant funding availability
  - Major cards accepted (Visa, Mastercard, Amex)
  - Standard processing fees apply

<Note>
  Your financial details stay private. The AI Agent only sees its available
  balance, never your funding sources.
</Note>

## How It Works

1. **Link Your Source**

   - Connect your bank or card in the Payman dashboard
   - Your details are encrypted and secured

2. **Add Funds When Needed**

   - Manually approve each funding transfer
   - Set up auto-funding rules with approvals
   - Get notifications for low balance

3. **AI Spends Safely**
   - AI can only access its allocated balance
   - Cannot exceed spending limits
   - No direct access to funding sources
