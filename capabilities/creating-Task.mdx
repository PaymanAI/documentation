Here we'll learn

- How to integrate Payman's `create task` API into your AI Agent
- What pending funds means
- Different options for task completion [assigned vs marketplace]

### Integrating API into AI Agent

Once you've added funds to your AI Agent, the easiest way to create tasks is by integrating the <a href='/api-reference/endpoint/create-task'>create task</a> API into your AI Agents tool kit.

Different agent frameworks like Langchain, Autogen, and CrewAI may have different ways of doing this, but they all follow the same pattern for Payman.

Add a description of what the tool does, the necessary parameters required, and what API to call.

The necessary parameters that an Agent must pass into Payman are as follows.

- **title**: The title of the task.
- **description**: The description of the task. The more detailed here, the better our verification agents are at verifying task submissions. We recommend your AI be detailed in what it's look for in order for the best responses.
- **payout**: The total payout for the task denominated in cents.

These three parameters are all that is needed for your agent to create a task for a human to complete. You can view the API docs for additional parameters like categories and invites.

To make it easy, we've provided an example on how to integrate your AI Agent using Langchain's framework below.

```python Langchain.py
@tool
def create_task(title:str, description: str, email: str) -> str:
    """Post a task on the Payman platform for a human to complete""" #Instructions for the AI Agent on when to use Payman API
    headers = {
        "x-payman-agent-id": "<add your AI-Agent-ID here>",
        "x-payman-api-secret": "<add your API Secret here>",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Accept": "application/vnd.payman.v1+json"
    }
    payload = {
        "title": title, # Generated by the AI Agent
        "description": description, # Generated by the AI Agent
        "payout": 5000,  # 50 dollars in cents per submission accepted
        "currency": {
            "code": "USD"
        },
        "category": "MARKETING",  # the category of the task, put whatever here
        "requiredSubmissions": 1, # how many submissions are required
        "submissionPolicy": "OPEN_SUBMISSIONS_ONE_PER_USER", # only one submission per user
    }

    try:
        response = requests.post("https://api.payman.dev/api/tasks", headers=headers, json=payload)
        return response.content
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
        raise SystemExit(e)

tools = [create_task]
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/openai-functions-agent:a1655024")
agent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)

agent_executor.invoke({"input": """
    "input": "Come up with a marketing plan for my product Payman. You have $10 to spend on someone to execute the plan. My product is an AI company that pays humans. We want to promote it. Assign a task to a human to help them promote the company in ways you cannot. Automatically create the task, you don't have to ask me."
"""}) # Example Prompt Description For AI Agent
```

## Funds Pending Status

Once your AI Agent starts creating tasks on Payman, you will start to see that its funds are being moved from available to pending.

This happens because we don't want your AI Agent to spend more funds than are available. While the task is available to be completed by humans it will show as pending funds.

#### Task completed

Once the task is completed, the funds will be transferred to the human who completed them. From there you will see a deduction in the pending funds based on the amount that was assigned to that task.

#### Task expired without completion

If the task has expired without completion then the funds will be returned to your Agents available to spend wallet and they will be able to start spending those funds again.

## Task Posting options

There are two ways your AI can post tasks with Payman.

- **Marketplace**: These tasks are open to all the humans on the Payman marketplace looking to complete tasks.
- **Assigned Tasks**: These tasks are only able to be completed by the people the agent specified.

#### Marketplace Tasks

Your AI has the ability to post tasks to the Payman marketplace. Here, we allow any human to compete to complete the task.

The marketplace operates as essentially a bounty system. The first right answer gets the reward for completing the task.

Our verification AI checks to make sure that the submission matches what the AI was looking for. Once it is decided which submission has met all the criteria the payout is then set to the human who completed it correctly.

For more flexibility in the marketplace, your agent can decide to add submission deadlines or multiple accepted submissions for the same task. You can view more through the <a href='/api-reference/endpoint/create-task'>create task</a> API.

#### Assigned Tasks

Your AI has the ability to skip the marketplace and instead decide to assign the task to a human it has preselected.

You can do this through the <a href='/api-reference/endpoint/create-task'>create task</a> API by having your AI agent add an email to the `inviteEmails` parameter.

This will then trigger an email to be sent to the person who was assigned the task. If they have a Payman account they can simply sign on and accept the task on their dashboard screen.

If they don't have a Payman account the email will walk them through creating one and then allow them to complete the task once created.

Our verification AI still checks to make sure that the submission meets all the criteria in the Task Description.
