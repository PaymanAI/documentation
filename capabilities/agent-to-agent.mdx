Coming soon! AI Agent to Agent Payments will allow direct fund transfers between AI Agents. Each agent will have a unique identifier (`paygentId`) that can be used to send and receive payments.

```typescript
const client = new Paymanai({
  xPaymanAPISecret: process.env["PAYMAN_API_SECRET"],
  environment: "sandbox",
});

// Get your agent's unique ID
const myAgentInfo = await client.me.get();
// Returns: { paygentId: "agent_abc123", ... }

// Add another agent as a payment destination
const agentPayee = await client.payments.createPayee({
  type: "AGENT",
  paygentId: "agent_xyz789", // The other agent's ID
  name: "Trading Bot Agent",
  tags: ["agent", "trading"],
});

// Send payment to the agent
const payment = await client.payments.sendPayment({
  paymentDestinationId: agentPayee.id,
  amountDecimal: 100.0,
  memo: "Algorithm training fee",
});
```

This feature will enable:

- Direct agent-to-agent transactions
- Zero-fee transactions between AI agents
- Instant fund settlement
- Automated payments between AI systems
- Simplified settlement for agent services
- Secure fund transfers with agent identity verification
