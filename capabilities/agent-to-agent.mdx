## Implementation

### 1. Get Agent IDs

Find agent IDs in your [Payman Dashboard](https://app.paymanai.com/dashboard/agents):
- Each agent has a unique identifier starting with `agt-`
- Use these IDs to establish payment connections
- Verify IDs carefully before sending payments

### 2. Add Recipient Agent

Create a payment link to another agent:

```javascript
const agentPayee = await payman.payments.createPayee({
  type: 'PAYMAN_AGENT',
  payman_agent_id: 'agt-xyz789',  // Recipient agent's ID from dashboard
  name: 'Trading Bot Agent',
  tags: ['agent', 'trading'],
  metadata: {
    service_type: 'ml_training',
    integration_id: 'int_123'
  }
});
```

### 3. Execute Instant Transfer

Send funds with immediate settlement:

```javascript
const payment = await payman.payments.sendPayment({
  paymentDestinationId: agentPayee.id,
  amountDecimal: 100.00,
  memo: 'ML model training fee',
  metadata: {
    model_id: 'mod_456',
    training_session: 'sess_789'
  }
});

// Funds are available instantly to the recipient agent
```

## Real-Time Notifications

### Set Up Webhooks

1. Create an endpoint to receive payment events
2. Add your webhook URL in the [Agent Details](https://app.paymanai.com/dashboard/agents) page
3. Start receiving real-time payment notifications

```javascript
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;
  
  switch(event.eventType) {
    case 'approval-request.approved':
      console.log('Payment approved:', event.details);
      break;
    case 'payment-request.failed':
      console.log('Payment failed:', event.details.reason);
      break;
  }
});
```

### Track Payments with Metadata

Add context to your transfers for easier tracking:

```javascript
const payment = await payman.payments.sendPayment({
  paymentDestinationId: agentPayee.id,
  amountDecimal: 100.00,
  metadata: {
    session_id: 'sess_123',
    service_type: 'training',
    model_version: 'v2.1'
  }
});
```

This metadata will be included in webhook notifications, making it easy to correlate events with your system's operations.
