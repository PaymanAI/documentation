### Set Spend Limits

Managing AI spending shouldn't be complicated. The Payman dashboard gives you powerful controls without writing a single line of code.

Simply log into your Payman dashboard and set:

- Daily spending caps
- Monthly budgets (fresh start on the 1st of each month)
- Per-transaction limits

## Streamlined Payment Approvals

Keep control while maintaining efficiency. Approve AI Agent transactions on the Payman Dashboard.

- All payments start with human approval required (safety first!)
- Set custom approval thresholds as you gain confidence
- Smaller transactions can flow automatically while keeping oversight on larger ones

For instance, set a $50 approval threshold and let smaller transactions process automatically while maintaining control over larger expenses.

<Note>
  Your spending limits are always enforced, regardless of approval settings.
  Safety and control, guaranteed.
</Note>

## Intelligent Customer Balance Management

Payman automatically handles the complexity of customer deposits with your spending rules:

- Customer deposits are tracked automatically
- Spending limits apply intelligently to customer transactions
- The system always enforces the stricter limit for safety
