### Set Spend Limits

If you wish to limit how much a given AI Agent is allowed to spend from a wallet you can do so via the Payman dashboard. Simply log into your Payman account,
navigate to the Agent Details Page in question and edit the spend limits for it.

You can specify daily, monthly or per-transaction limits. For example, you could allow an Agent to spend at most $2000 per day and
no more than $100 per payment. Monthly limits are calendar aligned so reset on the 1st of every month.

### Customers and Spend Limits

When you associate a customer (i.e. one of your Agent's users) with a payment, the spend is, by default limited to the amount that customer has deposited
into the wallet. However, any spend limits will be applied on top of this amount. For example, if a customer deposits $1000 into your wallet, and you have a
per-transaction spend limit of $100, the $100 limit will be applied to a customer's spend also. Conversely, if a customer deposits $20 into your wallet,
and you have a per-transaction spend limit of $100, the customer will still only be allowed to spend the $20 they deposited.

### Approval Requirements

By default an agent will require all its payments to be approved by a human before they are processed. This is to ensure that the Agent doesn't misspend funds through
erroneous prompt engineering or hallucinations. However, as confidence in the Agent grows, you may wish to limit this requirement. You can do so by adjusting the
approval requirements. Setting a new amount will allow the Agent to automatically spend any amounts below that threshold without approval. For example,
if you set the approval amount to $50.00, the Agent would then be allowed to spend up to $50.00 without an approval being required, but any amount more than that would still
trigger a human approval request.

<Note>
  Approval amounts do not override or replace spend limits. Thus if the agent
  has a per-transaction spend limit of $30.00, it will never be allowed to spend
  more than that in a single payment, regardless of the approval amount.
