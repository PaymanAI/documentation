### Set Spend Limits

If you wish to limit how much a given AI Agent is allowed to spend from a wallet you can do so via the Payman dashboard. Simply log into your Payman account,
nagivate to the Wallet's API Key in question and set a spend limit for it.

You can specify daily, weekly, monthly, all time or per-transaction limits. For example, you could allow an Agent to spend at most $2000 per day and
no more than $100 per payment. Weekly and Monthly limits are calendar aligned, meaning a week is any period from Sunday to Saturday, and a month is any
calendar month.

<Note>
  Setting an "all time" limit will create an absolute cap on the amount of money
  the Agent can spend from that wallet. Once they hit it, they will be unable to
  spend any further funds unless you increase the limit.

### Customers and Spend Limits

When you associate a customer (i.e. one of your Agent's users) with a payment, the spend is, by default limited to the amount that customer has deposited
into the wallet. However, any spend limits will be applied on top of this amount. For example, if a customer deposits $1000 into your wallet, and you have a
per-transaction spend limit of $100, the $100 limit will be applied to a customer's spend also. Conversely, if a customer deposits $20 into your wallet,
and you haev a per-transaction spend limit of $100, the customer will still only be allowed to spend the $20 they deposited.
