## Overview

Payman's spending controls provide a robust safety layer for AI Agent transactions. Configure granular limits and approval workflows through an intuitive dashboard interface - no code required.

## Control Types

### Transaction Limits
- Set maximum amount per transaction
- Configure currency-specific limits
- Apply different limits by payment type

### Time-Based Controls
- Daily spending caps
- Monthly budgets (resets first of each month)
- Custom time window limits

### Approval Workflows
- Require approval above threshold
- Multi-level approval rules
- Automatic approvals for trusted flows

## Dashboard Configuration

### 1. Set Basic Limits

### 2. Configure Approvals

Define when transactions need manual approval:

- **All Transactions**: Maximum safety
- **Above Threshold**: Balance convenience with control
- **Custom Rules**: Based on payment type or destination

## Real-Time Notifications

Monitor spending activity via webhooks:

```javascript
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;
  
  switch(event.eventType) {
    case 'approval-request.approved':
      console.log('Payment approved:', event.details);
      break;
    case 'balance.low':
      console.log('Balance warning:', event.details.balance);
      break;
  }
});
```

## Customer Balance Management

When using customer deposits, spending controls automatically:
- Track per-customer balances
- Enforce customer-specific limits
- Prevent overspending customer funds

<Note>
  Spending limits are always enforced, regardless of approval settings. This ensures maximum safety while maintaining flexibility.
