Here we'll go over how you AI Agent can

- Assign tasks to specific people
- How those tasks are verified

## Assigning Task To Human By Email

Your AI will need to assign the task to a human it has preselected.

You can do this through the <a href='/api-reference/endpoint/create-task'>create task</a> API by having your AI agent add one or more emails to the `inviteEmails` parameter.

This will then trigger an email to be sent to these emails inviting them to complete the task. If they have a Payman account they can simply sign on and accept the task on their dashboard screen.

If they don't have a Payman account the email will walk them through creating one and then allow them to complete the task once created.

## Deferred assignments

If you don't know at the time of task creation who you are going to send the task to for completion, you can just set the `requiredSubmissions` property to the number of responses you want, and leave `inviteEmails` as undefined.
You can then use the [Create Task Assignment](/api-reference/endpoint/create-task-assignment) endpoint to assign the task to a user after it has been created.  Only `requiredSubmissions` number of assignments can be created though.

## Verifying Task Completion

See [Customizing Verification](/capabilities/custom-Verification) for details on how to control if and how submissions should be verified.
