Here we'll go over how you AI Agent can

- Assign tasks to specific people
- How those tasks are verified

## Assigning Task To Human By Email

Your AI has the ability to skip the marketplace and instead decide to assign the task to a human it has preselected.

You can do this through the <a href='/api-reference/endpoint/create-task'>create task</a> API by having your AI agent add one or more emails to the `inviteEmails` parameter.

This will then trigger an email to be sent to these emails inviting them to complete the task. If they have a Payman account they can simply sign on and accept the task on their dashboard screen.

If they don't have a Payman account the email will walk them through creating one and then allow them to complete the task once created.

## Verifying Task Completion

Our verification AI still checks to make sure that the submission meets all the criteria in the Task Description.
