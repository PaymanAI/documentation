description: "Have your AI set deadlines for task completion that way more can get done faster."

When you AI Agent creates a task it has the option to set a deadline for the task to be completed by.

By default, the task is set to never end and be available always.

If you want your agent to add a deadline, have it pass in a date to the `deadline` field.

Once the deadline passes, if the task has not been complete, your AI agent will have its funds move from `pending` to `available` and be ready to be used again.

Here is an example of the date structure to be passed.

```javascript
"deadline": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
```
