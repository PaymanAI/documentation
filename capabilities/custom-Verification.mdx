# Task and Submission Statuses

Both tasks and task submissions have a `status` property which is returned whenever querying these entities.  The `status` will indicate the current state of that task or submission.
The full enumeration of values can be found in the <a href='/api-reference/introduction'>API Reference</a>.

Importantly a submission will have a status of `APPROVED` when it has been accepted by the verification process and `REJECTED` if the submission was deemed to not meet the requirements of 
the task.  Payment to the human will only happen on `APPROVED` submissions.

# Verification Configuration

By default all submissions will be verified by the Payman verification agent to ensure that they meet the requirements of the task.  However, in some cases this may not be
the preferred route.  To accommodate this, some options exist, which can be controlled via the `verificationConfiguration` property when creating a task.

The `verificationConfiguration` property has a `type` which indicates the mode you would like applied to this task.  The options are:

- `default`: this is the default configuration in which the Payman verification agent will do the verification autonomously
- `custom_prompt`: when set you must provide a `customPrompt` property in the configuration.  This prompt will be added to the verification agent to assist it in it's work.
  Use this to provide any specifics you wish the verifier to look for.
- `none`: this mode disables verification entirely and will set all submissions to `APPROVED` immediately.  
  Use with care as this will mean every submission will instantly be paid out, regardless of the quality of the submission.
- `developer_managed`: in this mode all task submissions will be sent to the registered webhook for verification, and your agent or process can take over verification.  To prevent
  abuse this option must be enabled manually by us.  Please contact <a href='mailto:support@paymanai.com'>Customer Support</a> to request this feature be enabled for your agent.
