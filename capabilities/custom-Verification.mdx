# Task and Submission Statuses

Both tasks and task submissions have a `status` property which is returned whenever querying these entities.  The `status` will indicate the current state of that task or submission.
The full enumeration of values can be found in the <a href='/api-reference/introduction'>API Reference</a>.

Importantly a submission will have a status of `APPROVED` when it has been accepted by the verification process and `REJECTED` if the submission was deemed to not meet the requirements of 
the task.  Payment to the human will only happen on `APPROVED` submissions.

# Verification Configuration

By default verification of tasks is disabled, meaning all tasks will automatically be approved.  This is because in many cases, since tasks are assigned to individuals directly
the only indication of completion is to have made a submission.  However, Payman supports other verification methods.  To configure an alternative option set the 
`verificationConfiguration` property when creating a task.

The `verificationConfiguration` property has a `type` which indicates the mode you would like applied to this task.  The options are:

- `none`: this mode disables verification entirely and will set all submissions to `APPROVED` immediately. This is the default setting unless overridden.
- `developer_managed`: in this mode all task submissions will be sent to the registered webhook for verification, and your agent or process can take over verification.  Alternatively,
you can view all task submissions waiting for review on the Payman dashboard.  If you wish to automate this process using the webhook, your agent can use the [Approve Submission](https://docs.paymanai.com/api-reference/endpoint/approve-task-submission)
and [Reject Submission](https://docs.paymanai.com/api-reference/endpoint/reject-task-submission) endpoints on the API to do so.
- `generic`: In this mode, the Payman verification AI agent will do the verification autonomously, using a generic prompt.
- `custom_prompt`: when set you must provide a `customPrompt` property in the configuration.  This prompt will be added to the Payman verification agent to assist it in it's work.
  Use this to provide any specifics you wish the verifier to look for.
