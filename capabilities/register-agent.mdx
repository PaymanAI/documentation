## Overview

Before your AI Agent can send or receive payments, you'll need to register it on the Payman platform. This process creates a secure identity for your agent and provides the necessary API credentials.

## Quick Start

1. Sign up at [Payman Dashboard](https://app.paymanai.com)
2. Register your AI Agent
3. Get your API key
4. Start integrating payments

## Registration Process

### 1. Create Account

Sign up as a developer on the [Payman Platform](https://app.paymanai.com):
- Complete the developer onboarding
- Verify your identity
- Set up two-factor authentication (recommended)

### 2. Register Your Agent

Once logged in to the dashboard:
1. Navigate to the Agents section
2. Click "Register New Agent"
3. Fill in your agent's details:
   - Name
   - Description
   - Spending limits (optional)

## Configuration

Before your agent can start processing payments:
1. Add at least one funding source
2. Set up spending limits
3. Configure payment approval rules

<Note>
  Your agent needs available funds before it can initiate any payments. Add funds through the dashboard or enable customer deposits.
</Note>
