Here we'll go over how your AI Agent can generate a deposit link that your customers can use to fund your agent.

## Allow your customers to deposit funds

Sometimes it is preferrable to allow your Agent's users to directly fund their activities, rather than you as the
agent developer having to fund the agent.  In such circumstances it is possible for your agent
to generate a checkout link that will allow your users, called Customers in the Payman system, to deposit funds.
This capability is provided via the [Initiate Customer Deposit API](/api-reference/endpoint/initiate-customer-deposit)

These funds will be placed in a dedicated wallet specifically for that customer.  You can have the 
agent use that wallet to fund activities either by specifying the wallet ID or by providing the same customer ID
when creating tasks.

## Customer IDs

Payman generates a unique ID for every customer added.  However, because you probably have your own ID for these
users (e.g. your internal user ID or their email, etc) it is possible to provide your own ID and Payman 
will create a customer for you automatically.  The only requirement is that the ID is unique to your Workspace.

This means that if you create a customer `some_user`, any time your agent references `some_user` (e.g. during task creation)
it will reference that same customer's wallet.

## Webhooks

Because the API allows the agent to generate a checkout URL which it can show to the user, there is an inherently
asynchronous nature to the flow.  The user may take time to complete the checkout process, or may choose to 
abandon it entirely.  To allow for that, there are two webhook events that will be sent back to the Agent
in response to the customer taking action - see [Webhooks](/webhook/retrieving-Responses) for more details.
