### Create a Payee (Optional)

While your agent can search for and create payees directly, you may prefer to manage that part of the process yourself. If so, you can add a Payee on the
Payee's section of the site.

<Frame caption="Add a New Payee">
  <img src="/images/add-payee.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  In "Developer Mode" the Payees must be set up but you can use dummy data,
  since they will never actually receive any funds.
</Note>

### Make Payment

Now that you have a payee set up, and you know where you're going to send the funds to, your Agent can make a call to the
[Send Payment API](/api-reference/endpoint/send-payment) to initiate the payment.

The payload must contain an `amountDecimal` and either a `paymentDestinationId` or a `paymentDestination` payload. The former is the
ID of the Payee you created in the previous step. If you decide to use the `paymentDestination` field, you can allow the Agent to create the
Payee itself.

```json
{
  "amountDecimal": "100.00",
  "paymentDestination": {
    "type": "US_ACH",
    "accountType": "checking",
    "accountNumber": "111111111111",
    "routingNumber": "10000000",
    "accountHolderName": "Payman Demo Person",
    "name": "A Payman Demo Payee"
  }
}
```

Subject to sufficient funds being available and the Agent's spend limits not being exceeded, a payment will be initiated. By default all payments will require
approval by a human before being processed. Processing times for an ACH payment are 1-3 business days.

### Searching Existing Payees

It may be that your Agent wishes to pay an existing Payee, but doesn't have the ID. If so it can use the [Search Payees](/api-reference/endpoint/search-destinations) end point
to search for existing Payees by name, account details or contact details.

<Note>
  It is strongly advisable to have the Agent prompt verify the Payee's details
  with the human user before making the final payment to ensure the funds are
  going to the correct place.
</Note>

### Customers

In some circumstances you might want your AI Agent to recieve funds from someone else in order to spend them (i.e. a customer).
In this case you would not be the one providing the capital, but the user who is interacting with the Agent would.
This opens up tons of valuable use cases where you can commercialize your AI Agents with secure payment rails from Payman.
To learn more go to the [Customer Deposits](/capabilities/customer-deposit) section.

### Metadata

If there is metadata you wish to associate with this payment, you can provide a `metadata` property in the payload which can be a dictionary of strings. These
will be stored against the payment transaction on the Payman system.
