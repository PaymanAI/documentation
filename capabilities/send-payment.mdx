### Sign Up To Payman Platform

Go to the <a href="https://app.paymanai.com">Payman web app</a> and sign up for an account. Sign up as a developer and get onboarded.

### Create a Payee

In order for your Agent to be able to securely pay someone, we first need to register the payment destination details on the Payman platform.
This prevents the Agent from having to know payment details such as bank accounts or routing numbers.

<Note>
  In "Developer Mode" the payment destinations must be set up but you can use
  dummy data, since they will never actually receive any funds.
</Note>

### Make Payment

Now that you have a payee set up, and you know where you're going to send the funds to, your Agent can make a call to the
[Send Payment API](/api-reference/endpoint/send-payment) to initiate the payment.

The payload must contain an `amountDecimal` and a `paymentDestinationId` which is the unique ID of the payee you set up in the previous step.

```json
{
  "amountDecimal": "100.00",
  "paymentDestinationId": "<your payment destination id>"
}
```

Subject to sufficient funds being available and the Agent's spend limits not being exceeded, the funds will then be sent to the specified Payee. Processing
times can vary depending on the transfer method.

### Customers

In some circumstances your Agent will want to make a payment on behalf of one of your users. Payman refers to these as "customers". If you provide a `customerId`
in the payload, the Payman platform will automatically associate the payment with that customer. The `customerId` can be an ID that you internally use to
refer to that customer, or the Payman generated one, as long as the customer ID is unique to your organization. You can optionally also specify a
`customerName` or `customerEmail` if you wish to record those details on the Payman system for easy identification later.

By default, when your Agent makes a payment on behalf of a customer, the amount they are permitted to spend is limited to the amount deposited by that customer
using the [Generate Customer Deposit Link API](/api-reference/endpoint/initiate-customer-deposit). This is to prevent customer A spending funds deposited by
customer B (or you). However, if you wish to allow this, you can set the `ignoreCustomerSpendLimits` property to true to disable this check.

### Metadata

If there is metadata you wish to associate with this payment, you can provide a `metadata` property in the payload which can be a dictionary of strings. These
will be stored against the payment transaction on the Payman system.
