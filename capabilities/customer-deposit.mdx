# Customer Deposits

Let your AI Agents users fund the AI Agent spends directly through automatically generated payment links.

## Quick Start

```javascript
// Generate a deposit link for a user
payload = {
  customerId: "someuser@test.com", // Let's assume your Agent system stores users unique by email address
  amountDecimal: "0.5", // Ask the customer to deposit 0.5 USD - note Payman fees will be deducted from this so actual amount received will be slightly less
  ignoreCustomerSpendLimits: false, //[Optional] enable this to true if you do not care about specific funding by customer
};
```

## How It Works

Your agent generates a checkout link using the Generate Customer Deposit Link API.

{" "}

<li>User completes payment through the link</li>
<li>Funds are credited to that user's balance</li>
<li>Your agent can now spend from that specific user's balance</li>

## Key Features

### Automatic Balance Tracking

<li>Payman tracks each customers balance for your AI Agent</li>
<li>Payments automatically deduct from the correct user's balance</li>
<li>Built-in overspend protection (optional)</li>

### Customer ID System

<li>Use your existing user IDs (email, internal ID, etc.)</li>
<li>Must be unique within your organization</li>
<li>Payman automatically creates customer profiles based on your IDs</li>

## Ignore Customer Spend Limits

There may be scenarios in which you do not care for the AI Agent to spend based on customer, but would like it to still collect funds from customers.
An example of this might be pooling funds from people in a game type setting and then letting the AI Agent decide what to do with those funds.
In this case enable `ignoreCustomerSpendLimits` to `true`.
