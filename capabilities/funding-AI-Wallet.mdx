### Sign Up To Payman Platform

Go to the <a href="https://app.paymanai.com">Payman web app</a> and sign up for an account. Sign up as a developer and get onboarded.

### Create a Wallet

Allow your AI Agent access to the platform by creating a Wallet and getting your Payman API Key. This will give the Agent the ability to spend funds to create tasks to get work done.

<Note>
  In "Developer Mode" a wallet will automatically be created for you, but once
  you want to move to production with real funds, you will need to go through
  this process yourself and transfer real funds into the wallet.
</Note>

### Fund Your Wallet & Get API Key

In order to create a new wallet you will need to add funds. Currently we support USD, with USDC coming soon.

Make sure you added a payment method you are trying to use as you will need it to fund your wallet.

<Note>
  In "Developer Mode" you can always top up your funds with test funds. In
  production mode you will need to have an attached payment method to let you
  fund your wallet.
</Note>
